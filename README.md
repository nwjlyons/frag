frag
====

Link to a location within a webpage

It's annoying to send someone a link and say “go here and search for X”. Ideally you'd send a URL with a fragment identifier (eg. http://example.com/page#fragment-identifier) but not all websites support this feature. 

Note

- Doesn't work on websites whose HTML is generated using javascript. eg. Single page apps.
- Doesn't work on websites that required a login.
